## Dynamic instructions
In most cases, you can provide instructions when you create the agent. However, you can also provide dynamic instructions via a function. The function will receive the agent and context, and must return the prompt. Both regular and async functions are accepted.

#### instructions Perameters
```bash
instructions: (
        str
        | Callable[
            [RunContextWrapper[TContext], Agent[TContext]],
            MaybeAwaitable[str],
        ]
        | None
    ) = None
    """The instructions for the agent. Will be used as the "system prompt" when this agent is
    invoked. Describes what the agent should do, and how it responds.

    Can either be a string, or a function that dynamically generates instructions for the agent. If
    you provide a function, it will be called with the context and the agent instance. It must
    return a string.
