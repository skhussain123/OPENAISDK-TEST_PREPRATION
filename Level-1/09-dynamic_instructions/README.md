# 🎭 Dynamic Instructions: Make Your Agent Adapt

## 🎯 What are Dynamic Instructions?

Think of **Dynamic Instructions** like a **smart assistant that changes its personality** based on who it's talking to. Instead of giving your agent the same instructions every time, you can make it adapt its behavior based on the situation.

### 🧒 Simple Analogy: The Chameleon Teacher

Imagine a teacher who:
- **Greets new students** warmly and introduces themselves
- **Gets more detailed** with students who ask follow-up questions  
- **Becomes more efficient** with students they've helped many times

Dynamic instructions let your AI agent do the same thing!

## 🎭 The Core Idea

Instead of static instructions like:
```python
agent = Agent(
    name="Assistant",
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant."  # ❌ Always the same
)
```

You can use a **function** that changes the instructions:
```python
from agents import RunContextWrapper, Agent

def dynamic_instructions(context: RunContextWrapper, agent: Agent) -> str:
    return f"You are {agent.name}. Adapt to the user's needs."

agent = Agent(
    name="Smart Assistant",
    instructions=dynamic_instructions  # ✅ Changes based on context
)
```

---

## 🔧 Function Signature

Dynamic instruction functions receive two parameters:

```python
from agents import RunContextWrapper, Agent

def dynamic_instructions(context: RunContextWrapper, agent: Agent) -> str:
    return f"The user's name is {context.context.name}. Help them with their questions."
```

### 📋 Parameters Explained

| Parameter | Type | What It Contains |
|-----------|------|------------------|
| **`context`** | `RunContextWrapper` | The conversation context, user data, messages |
| **`agent`** | `Agent` | The agent object with name, tools, settings |
| **Returns** | `str` | The instructions string for the agent |

## 🎯 Baby Steps Examples

### 1. **Simple Dynamic Instructions**

```python
from agents import RunContextWrapper, Agent

def basic_dynamic(context: RunContextWrapper, agent: Agent) -> str:
    return f"You are {agent.name}. Be helpful and friendly."

agent = Agent(
    name="Dynamic Agent",
    instructions=basic_dynamic
)
```

### 2. **Context-Aware Instructions**

```python
def context_aware(context: RunContextWrapper, agent: Agent) -> str:
    # Check how many messages in the conversation
    message_count = len(getattr(context, 'messages', []))
    
    if message_count == 0:
        return "You are a welcoming assistant. Introduce yourself!"
    elif message_count < 3:
        return "You are a helpful assistant. Be encouraging and detailed."
    else:
        return "You are an experienced assistant. Be concise but thorough."

agent = Agent(
    name="Context Aware Agent", 
    instructions=context_aware
)
```

### 3. **Time-Based Instructions**

```python
import datetime

def time_based(context: RunContextWrapper, agent: Agent) -> str:
    current_hour = datetime.datetime.now().hour
    
    if 6 <= current_hour < 12:
        return f"You are {agent.name}. Good morning! Be energetic and positive."
    elif 12 <= current_hour < 17:
        return f"You are {agent.name}. Good afternoon! Be focused and productive."
    else:
        return f"You are {agent.name}. Good evening! Be calm and helpful."

agent = Agent(
    name="Time Aware Agent",
    instructions=time_based
)
```

## 🎭 Advanced Examples

### 4. **Stateful Instructions (Remembers Interactions)**

```python
class StatefulInstructions:
    def __init__(self):
        self.interaction_count = 0
    
    def __call__(self, context: RunContextWrapper, agent: Agent) -> str:
        self.interaction_count += 1
        
        if self.interaction_count == 1:
            return "You are a learning assistant. This is our first interaction - be welcoming!"
        elif self.interaction_count <= 3:
            return f"You are a learning assistant. This is interaction #{self.interaction_count} - build on our conversation."
        else:
            return f"You are an experienced assistant. We've had {self.interaction_count} interactions - be efficient."

instruction_gen = StatefulInstructions()

agent = Agent(
    name="Stateful Agent",
    instructions=instruction_gen
)
```

### 5. **Async Dynamic Instructions**

```python
import asyncio

async def async_instructions(context: RunContextWrapper, agent: Agent) -> str:
    # Simulate fetching data from database
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
    current_time = datetime.datetime.now()
    
    return f"""You are {agent.name}, an AI assistant with real-time capabilities.
    Current time: {current_time.strftime('%H:%M')}
    Provide helpful and timely responses."""

agent = Agent(
    name="Async Agent",
    instructions=async_instructions
)
```

## 🔍 Understanding Context and Agent

### **Context Parameter**
The `context` contains:
- **Messages**: Conversation history
- **User data**: Custom user information
- **Run state**: Current execution state
- **Metadata**: Additional information

```python
def explore_context(context: RunContextWrapper, agent: Agent) -> str:
    # Access conversation messages
    messages = getattr(context, 'messages', [])
    message_count = len(messages)
    
    # Access user context (if available)
    user_name = getattr(context.context, 'name', 'User')
    
    return f"You are {agent.name}. Talking to {user_name}. Message #{message_count}."
```

### **Agent Parameter**
The `agent` contains:
- **Name**: Agent's identity
- **Tools**: Available tools
- **Settings**: Model settings
- **Configuration**: Agent configuration

```python
def explore_agent(context: RunContextWrapper, agent: Agent) -> str:
    # Access agent properties
    agent_name = agent.name
    tool_count = len(agent.tools)
    
    return f"You are {agent_name} with {tool_count} tools. Be helpful!"
```

## 🎯 When to Use Dynamic Instructions

| Use Case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Personalization** | Adapt based on user preferences |
| **Context Awareness** | Change behavior based on conversation history |
| **Time Sensitivity** | Different responses at different times |
| **Learning Progression** | Adapt as user becomes more experienced |
| **Multi-Modal** | Different instructions for different input types |

    if message_count == 0:
        return "You are a welcoming assistant. Say hello!"
    else:
        return f"You are an assistant. This is message #{message_count}. Be helpful!"
