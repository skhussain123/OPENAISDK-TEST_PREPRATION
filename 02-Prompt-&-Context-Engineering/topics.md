#### Key Topics Covered
The exam is divided into thematic sections, with questions building from basics to advanced applications.
1. Fundamentals
Primary goals and differences between prompt engineering (crafting instructions for desired outputs) and context engineering (providing relevant facts/documents for grounding).
How LLMs work (as prediction engines guessing next tokens, not human-like understanding).
Common failure modes (e.g., hallucinations from missing info, messy outputs from vague instructions).
Recommended workflows (prompt first, then ground with context; feeding tool outputs back in agentic flows).
Viewing LLMs as sophisticated autocomplete systems.

2. Configuration
Settings like temperature (controls randomness/creativity; low for consistency, high for diversity), top-K (limits to top likely tokens), top-P (nucleus sampling until probability threshold), output/token limits (affects length and cost).
Starting points for configs (conservative: low temp/top-P/K; balanced; creative: higher values).
Appropriate uses (e.g., temp 0 for math, higher for writing).

3. Prompting Techniques
Basic: zero-shot (direct question), few-shot (3–5 examples for patterns), one-shot.
Advanced: role prompting (assign persona), system prompting (behavior guidelines), Chain of Thought (CoT; "think step by step"), Self-Consistency (multiple paths, pick common answer), Step-Back (general question first), ReAct (reasoning + actions/tools), Tree of Thoughts (ToT; branching for complex decisions).
Tips like using "Let's think step by step" with temp=0 for consistency.

4. Best Practices & Pitfalls
Best practices: specific/action verbs, positive instructions, structured formats (e.g., JSON), variables for reusability, break complex tasks into chains, provide context from prior interactions, optimize token use.
Pitfalls: vague/ambiguous instructions (unpredictable outputs), overloading with constraints, negative constraints over positives, over-relying on tools without reasoning, excessive details/deadlines.
Examples of strong vs. weak prompts for analysis, coding, essays.

5. Testing and Evaluation
Frameworks: record prompt versions/goals/settings/quality notes.
A/B testing (compare versions), metrics (accuracy, relevance, completeness, style, format, consistency across runs).

6. Advanced Techniques and Tips
Context management in long conversations (summarize past, break tasks).
Prompt chaining (sequential steps), structured outputs (JSON for analysis).
Multi-modal prompting (explicit about image details).

7. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) & Prompting
MoE architecture: gating network/router selects experts (sub-networks), sparse activation for efficiency/scalability.
Impact on prompting: domain-specific signals upfront, separate mixed tasks, front-load cues, reduce temp for consistency.
Benefits/drawbacks: efficiency/specialization vs. routing instability/memory overhead.
Expert-aware prompting: explicit language/style, avoid vagueness.

8. Practical Application
Elements for effective prompts in content creation (topic, audience, tone, format), code generation (language, requirements, examples), customer feedback analysis (sentiment, themes, recommendations).

9. Context Engineering Integration 
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): prioritize relevant/newest passages, optimize chunking/ranking/deduping/token budgets.
Combining with prompts: prompts for behavior, context for knowledge.

10. Comprehensive/Applied Scenarios
Consolidated examples: optimized prompts for reports, Q&A bots, stories; addressing pitfalls in MoE (e.g., front-loading, low temp).

11. Context Engineering
Basics: LLM as CPU, context window as RAM; for building AI agents/apps.
Differences from prompt engineering (more comprehensive, code-like for agents).
Agent components: model, tools (external interaction), memory (dynamic history), knowledge (static info), orchestration, guardrails (behavior/safety), audio/speech.
Multi-agent systems: splitting tasks (e.g., search + summarize), sharing context.
Strategies: writing/selecting/compressing/isolating context, actions as decisions.
Advanced: architecture (state management, compression like hierarchical summarization), optimization (accuracy/latency/cost/recovery), security (isolation), memory hierarchies, RAG integration (semantic chunking), temporal reasoning (graph-based), enterprise trade-offs (modular components).

12. 6-Step Framework
Steps: strong command verbs (e.g., "analyze"), rule of three for context (who/what/when? or past/present/future), logic (reasoning/output format), roleplay (specify expertise), questions (iterative refinement until repetition), voice memos (natural follow-ups).
When to use extensive/minimal context (complex vs. simple tasks).
Great vs. weak prompters (use questions to refine).
Common mistakes: vague commands, generic info.
Benefits: transforms interactions into expert consultations.

13. AI Image Generation Prompting (Nano Banana)
Core principles: specificity over generality, visual hierarchy (subject → environment → lighting → technical details), professional photography language (camera terminology, lighting setups, photography styles). 
Anatomy of effective image prompts: subject description, pose/action, environment, lighting, style, technical specifications, mood/atmosphere. 
Professional photography terminology: lens specifications (85mm, 50mm, 35mm), aperture settings (f/1.4, f/2.8, f/8), depth of field effects (shallow for subject isolation, deep for environmental context), lighting patterns (Rembrandt, studio, natural window light). 
Best practices: anchor subject with "of the uploaded photo" for consistency, control scene with environment cues, specify style and mood (cinematic, corporate, fine art), borrow photography language for realism, add branding elements (text, logos, graphics). 
Style categories: corporate/professional (executive portraits, headshots, LinkedIn profiles), creative/artistic (fine art, black and white, documentary), fashion/editorial (magazine style, high fashion, editorial shoots), lifestyle/personal branding (environmental context, authentic moments). 
Common mistakes: being too vague, conflicting styles, overcomplicating prompts, missing key elements (lighting, pose, environment). 
Quality control checklist: subject clearly described, pose/positioning specific, lighting type and direction specified, environment/background detailed, camera/technical specs included, mood and style communicated, professional photography language used.


#### Study Tips:
**Essential Practice:**

* Hands-On Testing: Use free tools (Grok, ChatGPT for text; Google Gemini for images) to practice prompts. Test configuration variations and different techniques (CoT, ReAct, temperature settings).
* Master Key Distinctions: Memorize critical concepts - prompt vs. context engineering, top-K vs. top-P, agent components, MoE routing, photography terminology (85mm portraits, f/1.4 shallow depth, Rembrandt lighting).
* Example Analysis: Study successful/failed prompts from tutorials. For images, analyze the 6 Nano Banana examples; for text, understand why specific prompts succeed in different scenarios.

#### Structured Learning:
* Framework Application: Practice the 7-component image prompt structure (Subject → Pose → Environment → Lighting → Style → Technical → Mood) and 6-Step Framework for text prompts.
* Template Building: Create reusable templates for common tasks (corporate headshots, technical analysis, creative content) following best practices.
* Integration Focus: Understand how prompt + context work together in RAG systems and agents. Practice combining techniques across domains.

#### Quality Control:
* Before/After Comparisons: Rewrite weak prompts using specificity principles. Practice identifying vague vs. clear instructions.
* Systematic Checking: Use quality checklists before submitting any prompt. Ensure completeness of key elements.
* Failure Mode Recognition: Connect image generation failures (conflicting styles, missing elements) to general LLM issues (hallucinations, vague outputs).
* Advanced Preparation:
* Cross-Domain Application: Combine general prompt engineering (Chain of Thought) with specialized techniques (image generation, MoE routing).
* Supplementary Reading: Review transformer basics, RAG papers, MoE architectures. Practice on prompt engineering platforms for additional exposure.
