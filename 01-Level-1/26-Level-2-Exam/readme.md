### OpenAI Agents SDK core principles and architecture
- Python-first orchestration and control flow in agent development
- Agents, Tools, and Handoffs – roles, usage, and design patterns
- Runner methods (run_sync, run, run_streamed) – behaviors and blocking
- Pydantic models for input/output validation and default handling
- @function_tool decorator – usage and schema generation
- Dynamic instructions using callable functions with context
- AgentHooks and lifecycle event handling
- Synchronous vs asynchronous tools integration
- Input and output guardrails for validation and compliance
- Error handling during tool execution and error propagation
- Tool choice and tool use behavior (auto, required, stop_on_first_tool, etc.)
- Agent cloning vs creating new agents
- Context management with RunContextWrapper
- Conversation history handling in multi-agent handoffs
- Output type parsing and handling invalid or extra fields
- Prompt engineering techniques (system prompts, dynamic context, CoT)
- Planning reminders and reasoning in prompts
- Sensitive data handling and persona-based instruction design
- Multi-agent workflows and sequential orchestration
- Access control and permission checks for tools and handoffs
- Regional compliance filtering in handoffs (e.g., GDPR, US regulations)
- Feature gating and subscription-based tool access
- Custom runners with orchestration hooks and context engineering
- Keyword-based routing limitations in handoffs
- Audit logging and tool call tracking with tool_call_id
- Markdown basics (links and images)
