   **Answer**: c) `group_id`  

6. **What is the purpose of the `span_data` attribute in a Span?**  
   a) To store the start and end timestamps  
   b) To hold information specific to the Span, such as Agent or LLM generation details  
   c) To link the Span to its parent Trace  
   d) To disable the Span from being recorded  
   **Answer**: b) To hold information specific to the Span, such as Agent or LLM generation details

   a) "Default Workflow"  
   b) "Agent Workflow"  
   c) "Tracing Workflow"  
   d) "Main Workflow"  
   **Answer**: b) "Agent Workflow"  

9. **How can you group multiple `Runner.run()` calls into a single trace?**  
   a) By setting `group_id` in `RunConfig`  
   b) By wrapping the calls in a `trace()` context  
   c) By using `set_tracing_disabled(False)`  
   d) By enabling verbose logging  
   **Answer**: b) By wrapping the calls in a `trace()` context  

10. **What is the purpose of the `LocalTraceProcessor` class in the provided code?**  
    a) To disable tracing for all runs  
    b) To store and print trace and span data locally  
    c) To integrate with external tracing processors  
    d) To modify the agentâ€™s instructions  
    **Answer**: b) To store and print trace and span data locally  

11. **Which method in the `TracingProcessor` abstract class is called when a trace starts?**  
    a) `on_span_start`  
    b) `on_trace_start`  
    c) `force_flush`  
    d) `shutdown`  
    **Answer**: b) `on_trace_start`  

12. **What happens when the `shutdown` method is called in the `LocalTraceProcessor` class?**  
    a) It deletes all collected traces  
    b) It prints all collected trace and span data  
    c) It disables tracing for the current session  
    d) It flushes the spans to an external database  
    **Answer**: b) It prints all collected trace and span data  

13. **Which of the following is an external tracing processor supported by the Agents SDK?**  
    a) TensorFlow  
    b) LangSmith  
    c) PyTorch  
    d) Flask  
    **Answer**: b) LangSmith  

14. **What is the key difference between local tracing and dashboard tracing?**  
    a) Local tracing allows customization during a run, while dashboard tracing does not  
    b) Dashboard tracing stores data locally, while local tracing sends data to the cloud  
    c) Local tracing is disabled by default, while dashboard tracing is enabled  
    d) Dashboard tracing allows real-time modification of spans  
    **Answer**: a) Local tracing allows customization during a run, while dashboard tracing does not  

15. **What is the format requirement for a `trace_id` in the Agents SDK?**  
    a) `trace_<16_alphanumeric>`  
    b) `trace_<32_alphanumeric>`
