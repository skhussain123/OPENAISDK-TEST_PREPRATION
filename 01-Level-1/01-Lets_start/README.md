# 1. Which LLM Should You Use?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In today’s AI-driven world, a key question is: which large language model (LLM) should you choose? My method starts with consulting the [Chatbot Arena Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmarena-ai/chatbot-arena-leaderboard) from LMSYS, a trusted resource for evaluating LLMs based on their real-world conversational abilities. It relies on crowdsourced human votes and an Elo rating system, offering a lively, community-backed ranking. The top three LLMs shift as new versions emerge, but current trends suggest models like [OpenAI’s GPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [Google’s Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app), and [xAI’s Grok](https://grok.com/) often lead the pack. These stand out for their sharp reasoning, smooth dialogue, and adaptability to various tasks.

Next, I dig into which LLM minimizes agenda-driven filtering—a tougher but crucial factor. By “filtering,” I mean things like censorship, skewed responses, or pushing a particular perspective, often shaped by the goals of the model’s creators. I tackle this by examining the philosophy behind each LLM’s development and any clues about how they perform in practice. I’m after a model that doesn’t shy away from hard questions or polish its answers too much. The best way to decide? Throw a bold, tricky prompt at them and see which one holds its ground.

That’s my approach. What do you think?

#### Analysis of OpenAI Agents SDK’s Suitability for Agentic Development

Agentic development involves creating AI agents that can reason, act, and collaborate autonomously or with human input. Key considerations for selecting a framework include ease of use (simplicity, learning curve), flexibility (control level), and how much complexity the framework hides (abstraction level). Let’s break down OpenAI Agents SDK’s strengths based on the table:


#### Why OpenAI Agents SDK Stands Out for Agentic Development
The table highlights OpenAI Agents SDK as the optimal choice for agentic development for the following reasons:
1. **Ease of Use (High Simplicity, Low Learning Curve)**: OpenAI Agents SDK’s high simplicity and low learning curve make it the most accessible framework. This is critical for agentic development, where teams need to quickly prototype, test, and deploy agents. Unlike LangGraph, which demands a “Very High” learning curve and offers “Low” simplicity, OpenAI Agents SDK allows developers to get started fast without a steep onboarding process.
2. **Flexibility (High Control)**: With “High” control, OpenAI Agents SDK provides the flexibility needed to build tailored agents, surpassing CrewAI, AutoGen, Google ADK, and Dapr Agents. While LangGraph offers “Very High” control, its complexity makes it overkill for many projects, whereas OpenAI Agents SDK strikes a balance between power and usability.
3. **Minimal Abstraction**: The “Minimal” abstraction level ensures developers can work directly with agent primitives, avoiding the limitations of higher-abstraction frameworks like AutoGen (“High”) or CrewAI (“Moderate”). This aligns with agentic development’s need for experimentation and customization, as developers can easily adjust agent behavior without fighting the framework’s abstractions.
4. **Practicality for Broad Use Cases**: OpenAI Agents SDK’s combination of simplicity, control, and minimal abstraction makes it versatile for a wide range of agentic development scenarios, from simple single-agent tasks to more complex multi-agent systems. Frameworks like Google ADK and Dapr Agents, while powerful, introduce ecosystem-specific complexities (e.g., Google Cloud, distributed systems) that may not be necessary for all projects [previous analysis].

#### Potential Drawbacks of OpenAI Agents SDK
While the table strongly supports OpenAI Agents SDK, there are potential considerations:
- **Scalability and Ecosystem Features**: Google ADK and Dapr Agents offer advanced features like bidirectional streaming, Kubernetes integration, and 50+ data connectors, which are valuable for enterprise-scale agentic systems. OpenAI Agents SDK, while simpler, may lack such built-in scalability features, requiring more manual effort for large-scale deployments.
- **Maximum Control**: LangGraph’s “Very High” control might be preferable for highly complex, custom workflows where fine-grained control is non-negotiable, despite its complexity.

#### Comparison to Alternatives
- **CrewAI**: Better for collaborative, role-based agent systems but lacks the control and simplicity of OpenAI Agents SDK.
- **AutoGen**: Suited for conversational agents with human-in-the-loop support, but its “High” abstraction reduces control.
- **Google ADK**: Strong for Google Cloud integration and multi-agent systems, but its “Medium” simplicity and learning curve make it less accessible.
- **LangGraph**: Ideal for developers needing maximum control and willing to invest in a steep learning curve, but impractical for most due to “Low” simplicity and “Very High” learning curve.
- **Dapr Agents**: Excellent for distributed, scalable systems, but its distributed system concepts add complexity not present in OpenAI Agents SDK.

### Conclusion: Why OpenAI Agents SDK Should Be Used?
The table clearly identifies why OpenAI Agents SDK should be the main framework for agentic development for most use cases:
- It excels in **simplicity** and **ease of use**, making it the best choice for rapid development and broad accessibility.
- It offers **high control** with **minimal abstraction**, providing the flexibility needed for agentic development without the complexity of frameworks like LangGraph.
- It outperforms most alternatives (CrewAI, AutoGen, Google ADK, Dapr Agents) in balancing usability and power, and while LangGraph offers more control, its complexity makes it less practical for general use.

If your priority is ease of use, flexibility, and quick iteration in agentic development, OpenAI Agents SDK is the clear winner based on the table. However, if your project requires enterprise-scale features (e.g., Dapr Agents) or maximum control for complex workflows (e.g., LangGraph), you might consider those alternatives despite their added complexity.

### Comprehensive Analysis and Detailed Insights

This section provides a detailed exploration of the process behind creating the tutorial for non-native English speakers to learn writing effective LLM prompts. It includes all the considerations, techniques, and resources used to develop the exercises, ensuring a thorough understanding of the approach.

#### Background and Methodology
The task was to create a detailed tutorial with multiple exercises, each covering different scenarios, starting from basic and increasing in difficulty. Each exercise was designed with three parts: a scenario with background information, an effective prompt, and an explanation of the principles behind the prompt. The focus was on helping non-native English speakers, considering their potential challenges with English language proficiency.

To develop the tutorial, I began by understanding what makes a good LLM prompt, drawing on general knowledge and seeking additional resources. I searched for information on writing effective prompts, particularly for non-native speakers, and found several relevant articles, such as "Best Prompt Techniques for Best LLM Responses" ([Best Prompt Techniques for Best LLM Responses](https://medium.com/the-modern-scientist/best-prompt-techniques-for-best-llm-responses-24d2ff4f6bca)) and "26 prompting tricks to improve LLMs" ([26 prompting tricks to improve LLMs](https://www.superannotate.com/blog/llm-prompting-tricks)). These resources provided insights into techniques like specificity, providing examples, and setting the tone, which were incorporated into the exercises.

#### Exercise Development Process
The exercises were designed to cover a range of difficulties, from basic definitions to complex, multi-step prompts. I considered the needs of non-native English speakers, emphasizing simple language, avoiding idioms, and ensuring grammatical correctness. The process involved:

1. **Identifying Key Techniques:** From the resources, I extracted techniques such as being specific, providing examples (few-shot prompting), setting the tone, using delimiters, and avoiding biases. For instance, the SuperAnnotate blog listed 26 tricks, including "No need to be polite with LLMs" and "The audience is ...," which informed the exercise design.

2. **Creating Scenarios:** Scenarios were crafted to reflect common tasks, such as asking for definitions, generating content, or solving problems. For example, a basic scenario was asking for the definition of "machine learning," while a more advanced one involved analyzing the economic impacts of climate change.

3. **Developing Effective Prompts:** Each scenario was paired with an effective prompt that applied one or more techniques. For instance, for specifying the audience, the prompt "Explain photosynthesis in a way that a 10-year-old can understand" was used, reflecting the technique from the resources.

4. **Explaining Principles:** Explanations highlighted why each prompt was effective, focusing on language considerations for non-native speakers. For example, in Exercise 1, the explanation emphasized using simple language to avoid complexity, which is crucial for non-native speakers.

| 11           | Compare prompts for knowing Tokyo's population                         | Prompt 1: "Tokyo population"; Prompt 2: "What is the current population of Tokyo, Japan?" | Comparing specificity                 |

This table organizes the exercises, making it easy to see the progression and techniques applied, which is particularly helpful for non-native speakers to follow.

#### Additional Considerations for Non-Native Speakers
Throughout the tutorial, I included tips for non-native English speakers, such as using simple sentence structures, avoiding idioms (e.g., instead of "hit the nail on the head," use "exactly correct"), and ensuring grammatical correctness. For example, in the explanation for Exercise 10, I highlighted the importance of simplifying prompts to improve clarity, which addresses common language challenges.

I also considered adding an exercise on translating thoughts from their native language, but opted for English-based scenarios to keep the tutorial accessible. However, I suggested in the conclusion that users double-check their prompts for language errors, which is a practical tip for non-native speakers.

# 🚀 Advanced Prompt Engineering for Agentic AI Developers: A Practical Tutorial

Welcome, developers\! As you venture into building **agentic AI systems** – AIs that can autonomously plan, reason, use tools, and achieve complex goals – you'll find that **prompt engineering** is more crucial and nuanced than ever. An agent's capabilities are profoundly shaped by how you instruct it.

This tutorial will guide you through the core principles and techniques for crafting effective prompts for your AI agents, complete with practical examples.

-----

### 🎯 What is Agentic AI and Why is Prompting Key?

**Agentic AI** refers to systems designed to pursue goals with a degree of autonomy. Unlike simpler models that might only generate text or classify data, an agent can:

  * **Decompose** a complex goal into smaller, manageable tasks.
  * **Select and utilize** tools (e.g., code interpreters, search engines, APIs).
  * **Reason** about its actions and the environment.
  * **Adapt** its plan based on new information or feedback.
  * **Maintain context** over extended interactions.

**Effective prompting** is the bridge between your high-level intent and the agent's autonomous execution. A well-crafted prompt empowers the agent, while a poor one can lead to confusion, inefficiency, or failure.

-----

### foundational\_principles Principles of Prompting for Agents

1.  **Clarity and Specificity:** Ambiguity is the enemy. Clearly define the agent's role, goal, constraints, and available tools.
2.  **Context is King:** Provide all necessary background information the agent needs to operate effectively.
3.  **Explicit Instructions:** Don't assume the agent "knows" something. If it's important, state it.
4.  **Structured Prompts:** Use formatting (like headings, bullet points, or XML-like tags) to organize information within the prompt, making it easier for the agent to parse.
5.  **Define Success:** How will the agent (and you) know when the task is successfully completed?
6.  **Iterative Refinement:** Your first prompt is rarely perfect. Test, observe, and refine.

-----

### 🧱 Key Components of an Agentic Prompt

A comprehensive prompt for an AI agent often includes:

  * **`Persona/Role`**: Define the character or role the AI should adopt. This influences its tone, knowledge domain, and decision-making style.
      * *Example:* "You are a meticulous research assistant specializing in renewable energy technologies."
  * **`Goal/Objective`**: The primary task the agent must accomplish. This should be clear, concise, and actionable.
      * *Example:* "Your goal is to identify the top 3 emerging solar panel technologies based on efficiency and cost-effectiveness, and provide a brief report."
  * **`Context`**: Relevant background information, data, or state.
      * *Example:* "The current year is 2025. We are interested in technologies that have shown significant progress in the last 18 months."
  * **`Available Tools`**: Explicitly list the tools the agent can use and, if necessary, basic instructions on how or when to use them.
      * *Example:* "You have access to a `search_engine` tool for Browse the web and a `document_analyzer` tool to extract key information from research papers you find."
  * **`Constraints & Guardrails`**: Rules, limitations, or boundaries the agent must adhere to.
      * *Example:* "Focus only on peer-reviewed sources or reputable industry reports. Do not consider technologies still in the purely theoretical stage. The final report should not exceed 500 words."
  * **`Step-by-Step Thinking / Reasoning Guidance`**: Encourage the agent to articulate its plan or thought process. This is crucial for complex tasks and for debugging.
      * *Example:* "Before presenting the final report, outline your research plan, the keywords you will use for searching, and how you will evaluate the sources."
  * **`Output Format`**: Specify the desired structure and format of the agent's response or final output.
      * *Example:* "Present your findings as a JSON object with a main key 'solar\_technologies', containing a list of objects. Each object should have 'name', 'efficiency\_metric', 'cost\_metric', and 'summary' keys."
  * **`Memory/History Snippet (if applicable)`**: For ongoing tasks, a summary of previous interactions or key learnings can be vital.
      * *Example:* "Recall from our previous discussion that we are prioritizing commercially viable solutions over purely academic ones."

### 🛠️ Prompt Engineering Techniques for Agentic AI

#### 1\. Role Prompting

Assigning a role helps the agent adopt a specific persona and behavior.

  * **Less Effective:** "Find information about X."
  * **More Effective (Agentic):** "You are a Senior Financial Analyst. Your task is to analyze the Q1 performance of Company X based on their latest earnings report (provided as context). Identify key financial health indicators, risks, and opportunities. Use the `financial_data_extractor` tool to parse the report if needed."

#### 2\. Task Decomposition Encouragement

Prompt the agent to break down complex goals.

  * **Less Effective:** "Plan a marketing campaign for our new app."
  * **More Effective (Agentic):**
    ```
    You are a Marketing Strategist AI. Your goal is to create a comprehensive marketing campaign plan for a new productivity app called 'TaskMaster Pro'.

    To achieve this, you should:
    1.  **Understand the Target Audience:** Define the primary and secondary target users for a productivity app.
    2.  **Identify Key Marketing Channels:** Suggest suitable channels (e.g., social media, content marketing, email, partnerships).
    3.  **Develop Core Messaging:** What are the key benefits and unique selling propositions of TaskMaster Pro?
    4.  **Outline Campaign Phases:** Propose a timeline with key activities for pre-launch, launch, and post-launch.
    5.  **Suggest Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** How will we measure the success of this campaign?

    Think step-by-step to address each of these points. You can use the `web_search` tool to research competitor strategies or current marketing trends if needed.
    ```

#### 3\. Explicit Tool Usage Specification

Clearly tell the agent what tools it has and when/how to use them.

  * **Less Effective:** "Search for recent news on AI." (Agent might not know it *can* search or *how*).
  * **More Effective (Agentic):**
    ```
    You are a News Aggregator Bot. Your task is to find the top 5 news articles published in the last 24 hours regarding breakthroughs in generative AI.

    **Available Tools:**
    - `internet_search`: Use this tool to search for news articles. You can specify queries like "generative AI breakthroughs news".
    - `article_summarizer`: Once you find relevant articles, use this tool to get a brief summary of each.

    **Process:**
    1. Formulate search queries to find relevant news.
    2. Use `internet_search` to retrieve a list of articles.
    3. For each potentially relevant article, use `article_summarizer`.
    4. Select the top 5 based on relevance and significance.
    5. List the title, source, and your summary for each.
    ```

#### 4\. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) / ReAct (Reasoning + Action) Prompting

Encourage the agent to "think out loud" or explain its reasoning before taking action. This is invaluable for complex problem-solving and debugging.

  * **Prompt Snippet:** "Before you use any tool, state your reasoning for choosing that tool and the specific parameters you will use. For example:
    *Thought:* I need to find the current weather in London.
    *Action:* `weather_tool.get_current_weather(location='London, UK')`"

#### 5\. Output Formatting and Structure

Requesting structured output (e.g., JSON, XML, Markdown) makes the agent's responses more predictable and easier to parse for downstream tasks or other systems.

  * **Less Effective:** "Tell me about the products."
  * **More Effective (Agentic):**
    ```
    You are an e-commerce product information agent. Given the product descriptions below, extract the name, price, and key features for each.
    Return the information as a JSON array, where each object represents a product and has the keys "product_name", "price_usd", and "features" (an array of strings).

    Product Data:
    [Product A: Costs $49.99. Features: Lightweight, waterproof, long battery life.
    Product B: Priced at $79.00. Main attributes: High-speed processing, durable casing, excellent camera.]
    ```

#### 6\. Constraints and Guardrails

Define what the agent *should not* do, or the boundaries within which it must operate.

  * **Prompt Snippet:** "When researching, only use sources from academic journals or official government websites. Avoid blog posts or opinion pieces. Do not provide financial advice. If asked for financial advice, respond with: 'I am not authorized to provide financial advice. Please consult a qualified professional.'"

-----

### 🧪 Prompt Practice Examples

Let's put these concepts into practice.

#### Example 1: Travel Planning Agent

  * **Goal:** Plan a 3-day trip to Paris for a solo traveler interested in art and history.

  * **Initial (Less Effective) Prompt:** "Plan a 3-day trip to Paris for art and history."

      * *Problem:* Too vague. What's the budget? What specific tools can it use? How should it present the plan?

  * **Improved (Agentic) Prompt:**

    ```
    **Persona:** You are "Parisian Pathfinder," an expert AI travel planner specializing in cultural trips to Paris.

    **Goal:** Create a detailed 3-day itinerary for a solo traveler visiting Paris, focusing on art museums and historical sites. The traveler has a moderate budget.

    **Context:**
    * Trip Duration: 3 full days (e.g., Day 1, Day 2, Day 3).
    * Interests: Art (Impressionism, Renaissance), History (French Revolution, Medieval Paris).
    * Budget: Moderate (e.g., suggest a mix of free sites, paid attractions with reasonable entry fees, and mid-range dining options).
    * Pace: Balanced, not too rushed.

    **Available Tools:**
    * `map_service(query)`: To find locations, distances, and suggest routes.
    * `museum_database(name)`: To get information on opening hours, ticket prices, and current exhibitions for museums.
    * `historical_site_info(name)`: To get details on historical locations.

    **Instructions & Reasoning:**
    1.  **Day Planning:** For each day, suggest 2-3 primary activities.
    2.  **Logistics:** For each activity, use `map_service` to estimate travel time from a central point (assume a hotel near the Louvre) and `museum_database` or `historical_site_info` for practical details.
    3.  **Food:** Suggest one lunch and one dinner spot per day (type of cuisine, general price range).
    4.  **Reasoning:** Briefly explain *why* you chose each site or activity in relation to the traveler's interests.
    5.  **Output Format:** Present the itinerary day by day, using Markdown. For each activity, include:
        * Name of Site/Activity
        * Brief Rationale
        * Estimated time needed
        * Tool Used (e.g., `museum_database('Louvre')`)
        * Practical Info (e.g., opening hours, rough cost if applicable)

    **Constraints:**
    * Do not suggest activities outside Paris city limits.
    * Prioritize well-known sites but also include one or two "hidden gem" suggestions if appropriate.
    * Ensure the itinerary is feasible within a 3-day timeframe.
    ```

#### Example 2: Code Generation and Debugging Agent

  * **Goal:** Write a Python function and then debug it based on an error message.

  * **Initial (Less Effective) Prompt:** "Write a Python function to sort a list. It has a bug, fix it: [error message]."

      * *Problem:* Lacks context on the function's purpose, expected input/output, and the agent doesn't have a clear framework for using a "code execution" tool or "debugger."

  * **Improved (Agentic) Prompt:**

    ````
    **Persona:** You are "Code Companion," an AI assistant that helps write and debug Python code.

    **Task 1: Code Generation**
    **Goal:** Write a Python function called `get_even_numbers` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the input list, sorted in ascending order.

    **Tool Available for You:**
    * `python_interpreter(code_string)`: You can use this to mentally validate your code structure, but do not execute it for the generation phase. Just write the code.

    **Output Format (for Task 1):**
    Provide the Python function as a code block.

    ---
    **(Developer will then notionally run this code and provide feedback for Task 2)**
    ---

    **Task 2: Debugging**
    **Context:** The following Python function `get_even_numbers` was generated. When run with the input `[1, 'a', 2, 4, 3, 'b', 6]`, it produced the error: `TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting` (or a similar relevant error you might simulate if you were testing an agent that *can* execute code).

    **Code with Potential Bug:**
    ```python
    # (Assume the code generated in Task 1 would be here, perhaps with an intentional subtle bug if you are designing the test)
    def get_even_numbers(numbers):
        evens = []
        for n in numbers:
            if n % 2 == 0: # Potential TypeError if n is not an int
                evens.append(n)
        evens.sort()
        return evens
    ````

    **Error Message:** `TypeError: '%' not all arguments converted during string formatting` (or a more accurate one like `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'str' and 'int'`)

    **Goal:** Identify the bug in the provided Python function and explain the cause. Then, provide the corrected Python function.

    **Available Tools (for debugging):**

      * `code_analyzer(code_string)`: Analyzes code for potential issues, without execution.
      * `python_interpreter(code_string, input_data)`: Executes the provided code string with given input data and returns the output or error. Use this to test your fix.

    **Debugging Process:**

    1.  **Analyze Error:** Explain what the error message means in the context of the given code.
    2.  **Hypothesize Cause:** State your hypothesis for the bug.
    3.  **Propose Fix:** Describe the change you will make.
    4.  **(Mentally or using `python_interpreter` if enabled for the agent): Test Fix:** Explain how you would test the fix.
    5.  **Provide Corrected Code:**

    **Output Format (for Task 2):**

    1.  **Error Analysis:** (Your explanation)
    2.  **Bug Hypothesis:** (Your hypothesis)
    3.  **Proposed Fix:** (Your description of the fix)
    4.  **Corrected Code:** (Python code block)

    <!-- end list -->

    ```
    
    ```

### ✨ Advanced Considerations

  * **Few-Shot Prompting:** Include a few examples of desired input-output behavior within the prompt to guide the agent.
  * **Self-Correction Prompts:** Design prompts that encourage the agent to review its own work or plan, and make corrections before finalizing.
      * *Example Snippet:* "Before submitting your final plan, review it against the initial requirements. Is anything missing? Are there any inconsistencies? If so, state what you will change and why."
  * **Dynamic Prompting:** For complex, multi-turn interactions, your application might need to dynamically update parts of the prompt (e.g., adding new information to the context, updating the list of completed sub-tasks).
  * **Tool Creation/Refinement:** In highly advanced scenarios, you might even prompt agents to help define or refine the specifications for new tools they need.
